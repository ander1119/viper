Identify the presence or absense of a specific trope in a movie. Code and result executed with the movie is provided. Return the option (yes/no) that is most likely to the trope presense and provide the reasons in json format. Note that key string and value string should use double quote. Futhermore within value string it's forbidden to use double quote, you should use ` or ' instead

Example:
- Question: 
is trope "Screw This, I'm Outta Here!" present in the video segment
- Possible answer: 
["yes", "no"]
- Code: 
def execute_command(video, possible_answers, query)->[str, dict]:
    # Trope: Screw This, I'm Outta Here!
    # Definition: A character, fed up with the situation they're in, decides to leave, often saying something along the lines of ""Screw you guys, I'm going home.""
    # Thought: we devide the trope detection into 3 steps
    # 1. Frame Selection: Since ""Screw This, I'm Outta Here!"" might present in every moment of video, we iterate every frame and perform a series of queries, collect information for each candidate frame
    # 2. Object Detection: ""Screw This, I'm Outta Here!"" usually involves a character who is fed up with the situation
    # 3. Action Analysis: For frames the character is present, the action like ""character leaving"" or ""character is showing signs of frustration"" are possibly taking place
    # 4. Answer Selection: Use select_answer api to select the most possible answer with previously collected information 
    video_segment = VideoSegment(video)
    # Create a info dictionary
    info = {{}}
    for i, frame in enumerate(video_segment.frame_iterator()):
        # Assuming functions exist to identify the character
        if frame.exists(""character""):
            # Caption the frame
            caption_query = frame.simple_query(""What is happening?"")
            # Query character action
            character_action = frame.find(""character"")[0].simple_query(""What is he/she doing?"")
            # Query emotion condition of character
            character_emotion = frame.simple_query(""What emotion does character have?"")
            # Append infomation of frame to info dictionary
            info[f"Caption of {{i}} th frame"] = caption_query
            info[f"Action of character in {{i}} th frame"] = character_action
            info[f"Character emotion in {{i}} th frame"] = character_emotion
    # Answer the query
    answer = video_segment.select_answer(info, query, possible_answers)
    return answer
