Correct Example:
    def execute_command(video, annotation, possible_answers, query)->[str, dict]
        # Trope: Downer Ending
        # Definition: an ending that is sad, tragic, or otherwise less positive than the audience might have expected, often leaving the protagonist or key characters in a worse state than they were at the beginning or facing significant loss
        # Thought: we devide the trope detection into 3 steps
        # 1. Frame selection: "Downer Ending" refers to an ending, so we only analyze the final part of video segment
        # 2. Detection of emotional and contextual cues: Analyze the frames for visual cues of sadness, loss, or tragedy. This could involve detecting specific objects, settings, or facial expressions associated with negative outcomes
        # 3. Answer Selection: Use select_answer api to select the most possible answer with previously collected information 
        video_segment = VideoSegment(video, annotation)
        # Assuming the last 10% of the video is a reasonable segment to analyze for the ending
        ending_segment_start = int(video_segment.num_frames * 0.9)
        ending_segment = video_segment.trim(start=ending_segment_start)
        # Create a info dictionary

            subtitles_info = "Consider subtitles in frame: '" + ' '.join(frame.get_subtitles()) + "'"
            sadness_query = frame.simple_query(subtitles_info + "Is there sadness or mourning? Please answer with 'yes' or 'no'.")
