Correct example:
    # is trope "Kick the Dog" present in the video segment
    # possible answers: ['yes', 'no']
    def execute_command(video, possible_answers, query)->[str, dict]
        # Trope: Kick the Dog
        # Definition: an act of cruelty by a character, typically towards a more vulnerable or defenseless entity, to establish the character's malevolence
        # Thought: we devide the trope detection into 4 steps
        # 1. Frame Selection: Since "Kick the Dog" might present in every moment of video, we iterate every frame and perform a series of queries, collect information for each candidate frame
        # 2. Object Detection: "Kick the Dog" usually involves two characters like antagonist and victim(for example animal, child or visibly weakly character)
        # 3. Action Analysis: For frames antagonist and victim both present, the action like "antagonist attacking" or "victim is showing signs of distress" are possibly taking place
        # 4. Answer Selection: Use select_answer api to select the most possible answer with previously collected information 
        video_segment = VideoSegment(video)
        # Create a info dictionary
        info = {
