        # Trope: Adult Fear
        # Definition: Things that mature, well-adjusted adults generally are concerned about, as opposed to supernatural fears.
        # Thought: The trope detection involves three steps:
        # 1. Frame Selection: Iterate through each frame to find frames that contain elements related to adult fears.
        # 2. Object Detection: Identify objects or situations in the frames that are commonly associated with adult fears.
        # 3. Answer Selection: Use select_answer API to choose the most likely answer based on the collected information.

    reason to choose the answer: The trope 'Adult Fear' is relevant to the movie because it involves things that mature, well-adjusted adults generally are concerned about. From the captions and adult fears listed in multiple frames, it is clear that the movie includes fears related to people, flying, water, spiders, bed bugs, and snow, which are all common concerns for adults.

Potential Issues:
    {
        "lines": [
            "adult_themes_query = frame.simple_query("Are there elements representing adult concerns such as safety, health, or financial issues?")",
            "emotional_distress_query = frame.simple_query("Is there visible emotional distress related to adult fears?")"
        ]
        "reasons": [
            "Simplification of Complex Themes": "The queries are asking for a simple "yes" or "no" response to complex themes like safety, health, financial issues, and emotional distress. Adult fears can be nuanced and may not be adequately captured by a binary response. For example, a scene might depict financial stress in a subtle way that doesn't immediately register as a straightforward "yes" to the query, leading to an incomplete analysis.",
            "Lack of Detail": "The binary responses do not provide any detail or context about how these themes are represented in the scene. For example, the nature of the financial issue, the intensity of the emotional distress, or the specific aspect of safety that is being compromised are all lost in a simple "yes" or "no" answer.",
            "Impact on Trope Detection": "The decision to classify a scene as containing the "Adult Fear" trope is based on these binary responses. If the responses do not accurately capture the complexity of the theme, the final determination of whether the trope is present might be incorrect or lacking in nuance."
