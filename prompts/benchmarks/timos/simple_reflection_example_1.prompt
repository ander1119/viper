        # Trope: Adult Fear
        # Definition: Things that mature, well-adjusted adults generally are concerned about, as opposed to supernatural fears.
        # Thought: The trope detection involves three steps:
        # 1. Frame Selection: Iterate through each frame to find frames that contain elements related to adult fears.
        # 2. Object Detection: Identify objects or situations in the frames that are commonly associated with adult fears.
        # 3. Answer Selection: Use select_answer API to choose the most likely answer based on the collected information.

        "reasons": [
            "Generic Object Detection: The method relies on the hypothetical frame.exists("adult fear") call to identify objects related to adult fears. "Adult fear" is a broad and abstract concept rather than a specific, detectable object. This approach might fail because it expects the detection function to recognize a highly abstract concept directly, which is unlikely unless the system has been specifically trained on a well-defined and consistent visual representation of "adult fear.""
