        # Wrong Instructions: in line 24, if character_in_frame.overlaps_with(character.left, character.lower, character.right, character.upper), is apparently wrong, the function ImagePatch.overlaps_with() is used to determine whether a crop with the given coordinates overlaps with the ImagePatch
        # Correction Method: replace ImagePatch.overlaps_with() with other function
        # Additional Required Function: since we need to track character accross frames, we need an api to identify if two ImagePatch contains same person. And we define this function as below
        # def is_same_character(patch_a: ImagePatch, patch_b: ImagePatch) -> bool:
        #     # this function determine whether given image patches contains same character or not
        #     # Parameters:
        #     # - patch_a (ImagePatch): An ImagePath object represent a single character in a frame
        #     # - patch_b (ImagePatch): An ImagePath object represent a single character in a frame
        #     # Returns:
        #     # - bool: Whether two character is same or not
        #     # Note: In a real implementation, this function would likely utilize machine learning models trained on character
        #     # recognition and tracking to identify and distinguish between characters across different frames. It might involve
        #     # facial recognition, body posture analysis, and other visual cues to consistently track characters.
        #     # For the purpose of this example, let's assume we have access to such technology and can implement a simplified
        #     # version of this function.
