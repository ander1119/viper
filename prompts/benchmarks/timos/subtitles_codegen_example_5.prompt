        # Trope: Asshole Victim
        # Definition: A narrative trope where the victim of a crime or misdeed is someone who had it coming because they were themselves morally dubious or outright villainous.
        # Thought Process:
        # 1. Frame Selection: This trope involves identifying both the 'victim' and the act leading to their victimhood, suggesting a need for comprehensive analysis throughout the video.
        # 2. Character Analysis: Identify the 'victim' character and analyze their actions or character traits that justify the trope's criteria.
        # 3. Incident Analysis: Look for an incident within the video that cements the character's role as a victim.
        # 4. Morality Check: Determine if there's a narrative or visual cue indicating the victim's negative moral standing.
        # 5. Answer Selection: Using the collected data, decide whether the "Asshole Victim" trope is present.
