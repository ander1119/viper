    # Trope: Love at First Sight
    # Definition: An instance where two characters meet for the first time and immediately fall in love, often leading to significant plot developments.
    # Thought: The trope detection involves three steps:
    # 1. Frame Selection: Iterate through each frame to find when the two characters first meet.
    # 2. Emotional and Contextual Analysis: Analyze the frames for visual cues of love at first sight. This involves detecting facial expressions, body language, and any other indications of immediate romantic interest.
    # 3. Answer Selection: Use select_answer API to choose the most likely answer based on the collected information.

ImagePatch.exists() api is called with improper object_name("character A" and "character B"), since for same object the api can't distinguish their difference
