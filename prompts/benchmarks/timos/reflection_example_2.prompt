    # Definition: Things that mature, well-adjusted adults generally are concerned about, as opposed to supernatural fears.
    # Thought: The trope detection involves three steps:
    # 1. Frame Selection: Iterate through each frame to find frames that contain elements related to adult fears.
    # 2. Object Detection: Identify objects or situations in the frames that are commonly associated with adult fears.
    # 3. Answer Selection: Use select_answer API to choose the most likely answer based on the collected information.

This function was compiled and executed with specific video. Here's result:
    answer: 'yes'
    groundtruth: 'no'
    info: {
        - Caption of 2 th frame: people on bikes
        - Adult fear in 2 th frame: person
        - Caption of 4 th frame: person
        - Adult fear in 4 th frame: person
        - Caption of 5 th frame: people
        - Adult fear in 5 th frame: person
        - Caption of 7 th frame: person
        - Adult fear in 7 th frame: flying
        - Caption of 9 th frame: person, person and person
        - Adult fear in 9 th frame: person
        - Caption of 12 th frame: people walking down the stairs
    }
    reason to choose the answer: The trope 'Adult Fear' is relevant to the movie because it involves things that mature, well-adjusted adults generally are concerned about. From the captions and adult fears listed in multiple frames, it is clear that the movie includes fears related to people, flying, water, spiders, bed bugs, and snow, which are all common concerns for adults.

    # Wrong Instructions: in line 12, if frame.exists("adult fear"), adult fear is too vague for api to capture object or mistake object as adult fear 
    # Correction Method: replace frame.exists("adult fear") with some physical object like "bill", "insurance"
    # Additonal Required Function: since we need to know what potential object would related to adult fear, we need an new api to return such list
    # def get_physical_object(concept: str) -> list[str]:
    #     # this function return top 10 potential physical objects that highly related to the concept
    #     # Parameters:
    #     # - concept (str): abstract concept that is not physical object
    #     # Returns:
