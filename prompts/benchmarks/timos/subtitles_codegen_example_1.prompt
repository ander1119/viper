Correct Example:
    def execute_command(video, annotation, possible_answers, query)->[str, dict]
        # Trope: Kick the Dog
        # Definition: an act of cruelty by a character, typically towards a more vulnerable or defenseless entity, to establish the character's malevolence
        # Thought: we devide the trope detection into 4 steps
        # 1. Frame Selection: Since "Kick the Dog" might present in every moment of video, we iterate every frame and perform a series of queries, collect information for each candidate frame
        # 2. Object Detection: "Kick the Dog" usually involves two characters like antagonist and victim(for example animal, child or visibly weakly character)
        # 3. Action Analysis: For frames antagonist and victim both present, the action like "antagonist attacking" or "victim is showing signs of distress" are possibly taking place
        # 4. Answer Selection: Use select_answer api to select the most possible answer with previously collected information 
        video_segment = VideoSegment(video, annotation)
        # Create a info dictionary
        info = {}
        for i, frame in enumerate(video_segment.frame_iterator()):
            # Assuming functions exist to identify antagonist and victim
            if frame.exists("person"):
                
                # Caption the frame
                subtitles_info = "With subtitles '" + ' '.join(frame.get_subtitles()) + "'"
                caption_query = frame.simple_query("What is happening in the frame?" + subtitles_info)
                # Query antagonist / victim action
                antagonist_action = frame.find("antagonist")[0].simple_query("What is he/she doing?" + subtitles_info)
                victim_action = frame.find("victim")[0].simple_query("What is he/she doing?" + subtitles_info)
                # Query emotion condition of victim    
                victim_emotion = frame.simple_query("What emotion does victim have?" + subtitles_info)
                # Append infomation of frame to info dictionary
