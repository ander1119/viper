    # Trope: Big Bad
    # Definition: The character who is the direct cause of all of the bad happenings in a story.
    # Thought Process:
    # 1. Character Identification: Identify characters and track their actions across frames.
    # 2. Event Linking: Determine which negative events are directly caused by the actions of a character.
    # 3. Consistency Check: Check for consistency in the characterâ€™s negative influence over the story arc.
