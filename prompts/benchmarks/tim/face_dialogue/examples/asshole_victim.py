    # Trope: Asshole Victim
    # Definition: A narrative trope where the victim of a crime or misdeed is someone who had it coming because they were themselves morally dubious or outright villainous.
    # Thought Process:
    # 1. Frame Selection: This trope involves identifying both the 'victim' and the act leading to their victimhood, suggesting a need for comprehensive analysis throughout the video.
    # 2. Character Analysis: Identify each character and collect their actions or character traits
    # 3. Answer Selection: Using the collected data, decide whether the "Asshole Victim" trope is present.
