    # Trope: Kick the Dog
    # Definition: an act of cruelty by a character, typically towards a more vulnerable or defenseless entity, to establish the character's malevolence
    # Thought: we devide the trope detection into 4 steps
    # 1. Context Information Collection: To observe attacker's malevolence and victim's defenseless entity, we need to concern action and event in adjacent frames and use them as context to understand the story
    # 2. Event Observation: "Kick the Dog" would present in attack event within a frame. Use the context from first step as condition and query more detail in advance    
    # 3. Answer Selection: With information collected from second step, we leave the reasoning and question answering to select_answer api
    video_segment = VideoSegment(video, annotation)
    # Create a info dictionary, which would later pass to select_answer api
