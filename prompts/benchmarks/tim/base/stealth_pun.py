        # Trope: Stealth Pun
        # Definition: A joke, typically a pun, is included by the writers but is not highlighted with a punchline or explicit statement. It's hidden within the setup of the joke, requiring the audience to notice and interpret it themselves.
        # Thought Process:
        # 1. Frame Selection: Analyze each frame for potential visual or audio cues that might indicate a hidden joke or pun. This requires understanding both the context and the elements present in the scene.
        # 2. Contextual Analysis: Since the essence of a Stealth Pun lies in the setup and requires audience interpretation, we need to look for elements that are inconspicuously out of place or cleverly integrated into the context but might not be immediately obvious.
        # 3. Detecting Puns: This involves analyzing the text or dialogue for play on words, and visual elements for any visual puns or jokes that rely on the visual context but are not explicitly acknowledged in the video.
        # 4. Answer Selection: Use the select_answer API to determine the most probable answer based on the analyzed data, considering the subtlety and clever integration of puns within the video content.

        # Since Stealth Puns are about subtlety and not explicitly pointing out the joke, we need to balance detection with the likelihood of an actual pun being present without explicit acknowledgment.
