    # Trope: Kick the Dog
    # Definition: an act of cruelty by a character, typically towards a more vulnerable or defenseless entity, to establish the character's malevolence
    # Thought: we devide the trope detection into 4 steps
    # 1. Frame Selection: Since "Kick the Dog" might present in every moment of video, we iterate every frame and perform a series of queries, collect information for each candidate frame
    # 2. Object Detection: "Kick the Dog" usually involves two characters like antagonist and victim(for example animal, child or visibly weakly character)
    # 3. Action Analysis: For frames antagonist and victim both present, the action like "antagonist attacking" or "victim is showing signs of distress" are possibly taking place
    # 4. Answer Selection: Use select_answer api to select the most possible answer with previously collected information
