    # Trope: Asshole Victim
    # Definition: A narrative trope where the victim of a crime or misdeed is someone who had it coming because they were themselves morally dubious or outright villainous.
    # Thought Process:
    # 1. Frame Selection: This trope involves identifying both the 'victim' and the act leading to their victimhood, suggesting a need for comprehensive analysis throughout the video.
    # 2. Character Analysis: Identify the 'victim' character and analyze their actions or character traits that justify the trope's criteria.
    # 3. Incident Analysis: Look for an incident within the video that cements the character's role as a victim.
    # 4. Morality Check: Determine if there's a narrative or visual cue indicating the victim's negative moral standing.
    # 5. Answer Selection: Using the collected data, decide whether the "Asshole Victim" trope is present.
